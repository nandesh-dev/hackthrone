At Research Hive, we’re not forcing AI into our product, we’re using it where it truly excels. AI plays a focused role in organizing and interpreting unstructured research data, identifying meaningful patterns, and verifying contributions. Instead of over-automation, we leverage AI to enhance accuracy, transparency, and collaboration, ensuring technology serves researchers, not the other way around.

# Always Open
